//BossRoom Adventure.c
//By Ava Cordero
//Provides an interface for playing the game using the most recently generated rooms.
//In the game, the player will begin in the "starting room" and will win the game
//	automatically upon entering the "ending room", which causes the game to exit,
//	displaying the path taken by the player.
//During the game, the player can also enter a command that returns the current time
// -- this functionality utilizes mutexes and multithreading.

// Once the user has reached the End Room, the game should indicate that it has been
// reached. It should also print out the path the user has taken to get there, the 
//number of steps taken (not the number of rooms visited, which would be one higher 
//because of the start room), a congratulatory message, and then exit.

// When your program exits, set the exit status code to 0, and leave the rooms 
//directory in place, so that it can be examined.

// Your game program must also be able to return the current time of day by utilizing
//a second thread and mutex(es). I recommend you complete all other portions of this 
//assignment first, then add this mutex-based timekeeping component last of all. Use 
//the classic pthread library for this simple multithreading, which will require you 
//to use the "-lpthread" compile option switch with gcc (see below for compilation example).

// ...lock() is being called in multiple threads (i.e. having the only ...lock() and 
//...unlock() calls occur in one thread isn't using the mutex for control).
// Mutexes allow threads to jockey for contention by having multiple locks (attempt 
//to be) established. So, perhaps the main thread locks a mutex, then spawns the 
//second thread (whose first action is to attempt to gain control of the mutex by 
//calling ...lock(), which blocks the second thread). How is the second thread 
//started up again? By the first thread calling ...unlock().
// A thread can be told to wait for another to complete with the ...join() function, 
//resuming execution when the other thread finally terminates.
